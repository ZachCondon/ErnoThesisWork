# Overview of Repository

1. Spectrum Generation - 
   In this folder are the scripts needed to generate any spectra needed for this work.
2. Neural Network -
   This folder contains the code needed to run the neural network as I had it in my PhD. I code the network line by line to give me some easy ability to change things around, but there's a bit of a learning curve for that. To get the script to work, you need to have the whole folder because the script references all of the subfolders within the "NeuralNetwork" folder.
